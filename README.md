#### Dependencies : 

1. Visual Studio 
2. .NET Core 3.1 framework
3. Windows  x64 bit OS.

#### Classes and Methods:

1. complex_number class contains constructors for creating complex number types. This also contains methods for overloading operators * for multiplying two complex number types and for overloading operator +,-,/ for adding ,subtracting & dividing two complex number types. Also contains a string override method.
2. complex_matrix class contains constructor for creating complex matrices and operator overloading * for multiplying two complex number matrices, operator overloading / for dividing two complex matrices ,method for vector multiplication and method for printing the output of multiplication operation.
3. solution_class contains the main method.
